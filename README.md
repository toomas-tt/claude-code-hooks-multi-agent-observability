## Overview

This repository provides a system for real-time monitoring of Claude Code agents. It utilizes simple hook event tracking to gather and display agent performance data. This allows developers and system administrators to monitor their agents efficiently and make informed decisions based on real-time data.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data**: Get instant feedback on agent performance.
- **Simple Integration**: Easy to integrate with existing Claude Code agents.
- **Event Tracking**: Track specific events through hooks.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: Visualize data in an intuitive interface.
- **Custom Alerts**: Set up alerts for critical events.

## Installation

To install the package, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/toomas-tt/claude-code-hooks-multi-agent-observability.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd claude-code-hooks-multi-agent-observability
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. If you want to download the latest release, visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/toomas-tt/claude-code-hooks-multi-agent-observability/releases) to find the appropriate files. Download and execute the necessary file to get started.

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the monitoring system. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to set it up:

1. Import the library in your project:
   ```javascript
   const monitoring = require('claude-code-hooks-multi-agent-observability');
   ```

2. Initialize the monitoring system:
   ```javascript
   monitoring.init({
       agents: ['agent1', 'agent2'],
       hooks: {
           onEvent: (event) => {
               console.log('Event tracked:', event);
           }
       }
   });
   ```

3. Start monitoring:
   ```javascript
   monitoring.start();
   ```

This will begin tracking events for the specified agents. You can customize the hooks to handle events as needed.

## Configuration

The configuration options allow you to tailor the monitoring system to your needs. Here are the available options:

- **agents**: An array of agent names to monitor.
- **hooks**: An object containing event handlers.
  - **onEvent**: Function to call when an event occurs.
  - **onError**: Function to call when an error occurs.
- **alertThreshold**: Set a threshold for alerts based on performance metrics.

### Example Configuration

```javascript
monitoring.init({
    agents: ['agent1', 'agent2'],
    hooks: {
        onEvent: (event) => {
            console.log('Event tracked:', event);
        },
        onError: (error) => {
            console.error('Error tracked:', error);
        }
    },
    alertThreshold: 80
});
```
